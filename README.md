# Interfaces
![build workflow](https://github.com/conradmugabe/interfaces/actions/workflows/testing.yml/badge.svg)

Implementation of interfaces using python.

## Why use interfaces?

Interfaces help us reduce coupling within our code.

So, instead of depending on an actual implementation of a class, we can switch to an abstraction.

We do this through depedency injection. Which is one of the SOLID principles.
